    <h2>OJT Experience</h2>
    <p>I’ve been a fullstack developer at Nexlogic 
        Telecommunications Network Inc. which ourexperience 
        we used Django for developing different programs. 
        I was assigned to do a TimeLogger for the incoming 
        interns for the company, I was the main developer 
        of that time togetherwith my partner who is assigned 
        for designing. It was a telegram bot having 2 databases 
        of Django and together with the Google Worksheet with the 
        use of different API’s. After thecompletion of my assigned 
        task, I was assigned to help to a Project called TMAP which 
        is a Topology Asset Profiler which will be used with the company 
        I created a Telegram Bot for it since Iwas the one knowledgeable 
        about it. This Telegram Bot can update the ports of the website 
        without leaving the telegram itself with the help of js.
